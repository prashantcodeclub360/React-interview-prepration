# What is componnets in raect ?

> Components are like functions that return HTML elements.
> Components are independent and reusable bits of code and Function components.
> When creating a React component, the component's name MUST start with an upper case letter.

## What is class componets ?

- A class component must include the extends React.Component statement. This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.

## Function Component

> Here is the same example as above, but created using a Function component instead.
> A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, but Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand,

- Example
  > Create a Function component called Car
       function Car() {
         return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
      }
